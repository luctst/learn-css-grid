1. To create your first grid simply add `display: grid` on your element.
2. Once your grid is create you have to create your columns to do that, use the `grid-template-columns` instruction and add as many as you want columns.
3. You can do the same with row with the `grid-template-rows` instruction.
4. If you want you can create some gap with the `grid-gap` instruction.
5. In `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` one parameter is equal to one column or one row, and don't forget to give size to your rows and columns.
