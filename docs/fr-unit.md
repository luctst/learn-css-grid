## Fr unit

1. We create our `grid-template-columns` with the new unit by adding `fr` to our columns.
2. The `fr` unit divide the space in fractional unit, for example here our `container` is divide in 3 columns, so `1fr` will take 1 part of the available space.
3. The `fr` unit work also with `grid-template-rows`.
